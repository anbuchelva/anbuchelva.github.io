There were 60+ users using the bot and few setup their own bot at a time and the count started reducing to single digit. I expected that as long as there in any interactions from users, it will not work out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started setting up the API based bot 3+ months go and showed how to setup their own in the telegram group. Some are using it and found it is useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to write a proper document how to set it up so that it would be easy to implement. This bot will not be available centrally as it contains lot of personal information and holds lot of data which doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle the free usage provided by Google and Telegram as highlighted in the previous post. So, if you plan to use it, you need to get your hands dirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OCR based bot is continue to exist, there&amp;rsquo;s no change on that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collect Ather Logs in Google Sheets via Telegram Bot</title><link>https://anbuchelva.in/posts/appscript/collect-ather-logs-to-google-sheets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anbuchelva.in/posts/appscript/collect-ather-logs-to-google-sheets/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been using the Ather 450X for over 8 months now.

&lt;p>The Ather app provides statistics such as the last 20 rides, monthly ride logs, charging statistics, etc. However, they recently stopped sending monthly logs. To continue analyzing the data, I decided to collect the logs myself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forestry.io as CMS for Hexo</title><link>https://anbuchelva.in/posts/blog/forestry-io-as-cms-for-hexo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anbuchelva.in/posts/blog/forestry-io-as-cms-for-hexo/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many ways to write and publish blog posts, when it comes to git backed static websites.
