There were 60+ users using the bot and few setup their own bot at a time and the count started reducing to single digit. I expected that as long as there in any interactions from users, it will not work out.\nI started setting up the API based bot 3+ months go and showed how to setup their own in the telegram group. Some are using it and found it is useful.\nI want to write a proper document how to set it up so that it would be easy to implement. This bot will not be available centrally as it contains lot of personal information and holds lot of data which doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle the free usage provided by Google and Telegram as highlighted in the previous post. So, if you plan to use it, you need to get your hands dirty.\nThe OCR based bot is continue to exist, there\u0026rsquo;s no change on that.\nPurpose #This is just the enhanced version of the previous OCR based bot, with less uers interaction with more data such as ride mode, braking, coasting distance, etc.,\nThe Ather mobile app stores only the last 20 rides. If the a person uses OCR based bot then (s)he can get the last 20 rides only. The automated bot extracts all the historical data from the vehicle purchase time.\nOne important thing to note, Ather might block this api access in future. So it may or may not work. They already blocked api access for any manual triggers that are done from Google App script.\nRequirements # You should be the owner of Ather Vehicle and you should have the option (password or OTP) to login to Ather mobile app. An Android phone with USB debugging enabled. A PC with Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed (Google it how to install adb tools on pc) Ather connect subscription. A google account to store the ride details. A telegram account to interact with the data and getting alerts. Patience bro! To access the ride log records, you need to get access to the Ather\u0026rsquo;s FireBase database using your Ather mobile app. Don\u0026rsquo;t share your login credentials to any anyone unless you completely trust them. How It Works # User takes a ride, the relevant data would be shared to Ather for their analysis. Ather stores the data in their FireBase database. A script retrieves the data using API endpoints on a periodical interval and stores it in Google sheet. Telegram bot send an alert to the owner when there is an update / new ride. In addition, user can interact with bot for charts and analysis. Setup #Get API Key from Ather app # Windows User: Make sure you have installed ADB drivers on your PC, then download the platform tools zip file from Google\u0026rsquo;s android developers website. You may find lot of resources in the internet and youtube videos to complete it. Linux User: Use sudo apt install adb fastboot on debian based PC; sudo pacman -S android-tools on arch based PC. Go to your Android Phone \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; About Phone \u0026gt; Build Number \u0026gt; Tap 7 times till you get a message that shows that You are now a developer. This may be available in different places, depends on the phone manufacturer. Windows User: Open command prompt or terminal on your PC and go to the platform tools folder. Connect your phone to your PC using an USB cable, then run adb devices command in the terminal window. You should get a message on your mobile phone to accept the authorization from your PC. Accept it. Run adb devices command once more. It should display your mobile phone\u0026rsquo;s ID then a word device. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be seeing unauthorized next to the phone ID, which represents that the phone is not authorized it yet. Run adb logcat | grep user_cb_token command if you are using linux; adb logcat | findstr user_cb_token command if you are using windows. Open Ather mobile app and go to the Charger section on the bottom (should be on the 2nd item). Check for the below output. \u0026lt;timestamp\u0026gt;Â \u0026lt;pid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pid\u0026gt; D user_cb_token: Bearer \u0026lt;400+ character random text\u0026gt; The 400+ random character is your API TOKEN. Keep it safe for future use; do not share it with anyone. Get your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) #This should be available in your RC book or in the boot.\nRefer this as VIN. Setting up Telegram Bot # Search for BotFather on Telegram or use this link: https://t.me/BotFather. Start a chat and choose /newbot from the menu. Provide basic information such as Bot\u0026rsquo;s name and username (naming rules apply). Refer this API Token as BOT TOKEN. Get your Telegram Numeric ID #Go to https://t.me/userinfobot on your telegram client and say hi. You will get a numeric value. Refer this as ADMIN ID. Get API Key from Bing Maps #Go to https://www.bingmapsportal.com/ login with your Microsoft Account. Follow the steps to get an API key. This will help you to get the location name of the start and end place.\nRefer this as MAPS_KEY. Google Slide #Create a new Google slide file in your Google Drive. Get the ID of the slide and keep it for later use. Lets call it as SLIDE_ID. Google Sheets #Make a copy of this Google Sheet: Google Sheets Template. It will ask you to name the file and also highlight that the scripts also will be saved. You can rename the sheet the way you want and click \u0026lsquo;Make a copy\u0026rsquo;. Once the file is saved, you will be able to make edits to the sheet. Make sure you check copy comments option.\nKnow your Vehicle to know the SOC Capacity #Go to the options sheet and find the battery capacity from range A11 to B17\nRefer this as SOC_CAPACITY. Fill the details in options Sheet #Go to options sheet and fill the details on yellow highlighted cell (from cell B2 to B8) that you got from above steps. Keep the WEBHOOK_URL as blank. Setting up Script #Access Google Apps Script via the \u0026ldquo;Extensions\u0026rdquo; menu in Google Sheets. Rename the project to match your sheet\u0026rsquo;s name (optional). Deploy the script, authorizing necessary permissions. You will get a pop-up like below. Make sure you select the highlighted poritions. If you make mistakes here, your bot will not work.\nThen you need to follow the steps as highlighted in the screenshots. These steps are required to access your google drive, google sheets, google docs and slides, to process further.\nChoose your gmail ID, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use your primary gmail you can create a new one. You will get a warning that the app is unverified. Click advanced Click go to \u0026lsquo;your google sheet file name\u0026rsquo; Click Allow You will get a deployment URL. Keep it safe and do not share it with anyone. Refer this URL as WEBHOOK_URL and update the same in the Options sheet. Multiple deployments (Not required for first time) #Do not use New Deployment multiple times, if you do the WEBHOOK_URL will change.\nIf you wish to deployment again go to Deploy \u0026gt; Manage Deployments \u0026gt; Click Pencil Icon \u0026gt; Version to New Version \u0026gt; Deploy. This will retain the WEBHOOK_URL as same.\nIMPORTANT This step has to be done whenever we change something on the code or script properties. Update Script Properties #Now go to Misc.gs on the left panel, select UpdateScriptProperties function from drop down then click Run. This will update the script properties that you fill in \u0026lsquo;options\u0026rsquo; sheet. The above step can be manually done by clicking the gear icon on the left pane, which will open up the project settings. Scroll to the bottom where you can see the Script Properties.\nSetup Webhook #Go to Script editor from the left pane. Then go to bot.gs file. You will see many functions like getMe(), setWebhook(), etc.,\nfrom the top select getMe then click Run. You will get a success message in the execution log on the bottom. Now do the same for setWebhook. if you are getting a result as \u0026lsquo;ok: true\u0026rsquo; then, you have followed the steps without any mistakes. Run deleteWebook function if you are using the same bot with a different google sheet. Then do the setWebook. Once the webhook setup is complete the telegram bot that you have created above will start working.\nOpen the telegram app and open the bot that you have created. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the bot, the link would be available in BotFather. Hit \u0026lsquo;Start\u0026rsquo; button.\nSetup Triggers for extracting Historical Data #Click on the left panel and click Triggers. Then click Add Trigger button. Create a trigger to trigger the firstRun function as mentioned below. Enter current date and current time + 2 minutes in the \u0026lsquo;Enter Date/Time\u0026rsquo; field. Google app script would run for maximum 90 seconds. The function would extract approximately 1400 lines of data from the server in that time. You need to schedule it again till you get the latest ride (refer data sheet in Google sheet). If you get any errors in this step, your ather TOKEN or MAPS_KEY might be wrong.\nSetup Triggers for Ride Alert #Once you get the historical data, click \u0026lsquo;Add Trigger\u0026rsquo; again and setup trigger for \u0026rsquo;triggerApi\u0026rsquo; function. Now the \u0026lsquo;Select type of time based trigger\u0026rsquo; field should be \u0026lsquo;Minutes Timer\u0026rsquo; and minute interval should be 10 minutes. Running these scripts directly from the App Script window would fail, as ather has already blocked those IP address. It works only by scheduling, until ather blocks them. Usage #Start the bot or send /start command to the bot, it would repond with the shortcut keys to interact with the bot.\nFollowing are the shortcut keys (not case sensitive) at this time the blog post is published.\nD - Daily Charts\nW - Weekly Charts\nM - Monthly Charts\nT - Trigger API \u0026amp; enable Triggers\nG - Get API Status\nO - Toggele Triggers ON or OFF\nDS - Daily Summary\nWS - Weekly Summary\nMS - Monthly Summary\nset A/B/C - Set Trip A/B/C\nget A/B/C - Get Trip A/B/C info\nAT \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; - will replace the Ather token\u0026rsquo;\nI strongly suggest that disable the api triggers when you are not using the vehicle by sending command O. So that, we don\u0026rsquo;t overuse the api access and its win-win for users and Ather. For questions, contact me on this Telegram channel. I\u0026rsquo;ll respond when available, but immediate support isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed.\nThe code behind this process is open and available in github repository under \u0026lsquo;auto\u0026rsquo; branch. Adding a â­ would be much appreciated.\n","date":"17 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/appscript/collect-ather-logs-using-api/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt has been 6+ months since the OCR based telegram bot was setup and opened to users.

I prefer driving this vehicle more compared to my previous ones.\nThe Ather app provides statistics such as the last 20 rides, monthly ride logs, charging statistics, etc. However, they recently stopped sending monthly logs. To continue analyzing the data, I decided to collect the logs myself.\nPurpose #My aim was to track trends in my monthly driving distance, monitor expected range variations, and evaluate whether these metrics are increasing or decreasing over time. The monthly ride logs were helpful, but since Ather discontinued them, there\u0026rsquo;s no single place to view all the monthly data. I used to rely on my previous emails to access them.\nI wanted to take charge of collecting the logs, incorporate additional metrics not provided by Ather, such as Battery Usage for each ride, Daily and Monthly Battery Usage, and Battery Consumption per Kilometer. By managing my data, I can access it at my convenience.\nThought Process #Initially, I considered manually collecting statistics using a webpage. However, I realized this could become cumbersome and might discourage me from maintaining the logs over time. I opted for the option in the Ather app to share ride statistics as images for their marketing purposes.\nI planned to run Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on these images to extract relevant text values and then organize them systematically. This way, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t lose interest in maintaining the logs, as it require less work.\nTools #I needed tools for the following steps:\nCollect input from the Ather app. Process OCR and convert to data points. Store organized data. Set up reports for trend analysis. Automate the process. Keep costs low or free. After consideration, I settled on the following tools:\nCollect input from Ather app: Telegram / Telegram bot. Process OCR and convert to data points: Google Docs. Store organized data: Google Sheets. Set up trend analysis reports: Google Sheets. Automate the process: Google Scripts. Keep costs low or free: All tools above are free within certain limits. How It Works # Open the Ather app and access ride statistics, which includes details like Date, Distance Traveled, Time Spent, Efficiency, Projected Range, and Top Speed for the last 20 rides. Share the ride statistics image with my Telegram bot. The bot sends the image to Google Drive. A script retrieves the image, converts it to text and data points. The script organizes the data and places it in the correct columns. Google Sheets summarizes the data and generates update charts. The Telegram bot sends a summary of the extracted image information. The Telegram bot provides options to view ride statistics as graphs. Setup #Requirements #To set up a similar system for personal use, you\u0026rsquo;ll need:\nA Google account. A Telegram account. A computer (setting up on a mobile device is challenging). Some time and patience. Setting up Telegram Bot # Search for BotFather on Telegram or use this link: https://t.me/BotFather.

I started with text editor for writing, terminal for building, then push it to Github pages for publishing. Then I started using Netlify for building static pages, but was still using text editor and terminal locally.\nOne fine day, I set up Netlify CMS for content management, as I wanted it to write in any PC, which do not have git \u0026amp; npm installed. I tried forestry.io for writing posts for Jekyll \u0026amp; Hugo (during my initial testing to decide which static site platform to choose). But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it work for Hexo during the initial times.\nNow I have succeeded using forestry.io as CMS for Hexo and this post is being written in the same platform and sharing my experiences here. Thanks for the help from Frank Taillandier.\nThere is a post that explains how to Integrate Netlify CMS with Hexo. You may refer it, which will be useful to understand the CMS on hexo platform. Steps to Connect Hexo #Login to forestry.io, then click add site button. There is no dedicated option available to connect to Hexo, use the other option.\nThen select your git based repository provider, where your blog sources are located, keep the Quick Setup via OAuth checked.\nSelect your repository and the right branch.\nConfigure Sidebar #Once imported, you will get a wizard to configure sidebar; by doing it forestry creates a folder in the git repo named .forestry, where all the configuration files are stored.\nYou can refer this blog\u0026rsquo;s config here. You can configure the sidebar manually or you can just take those files from my repo and place it in yours.\nHandle Media #You can connect to any of the following sources to source your images.\nRepository, where the blog is being sourced Cloudinary Amazon S3 Netlify Large Media There are two paths/folders to be mentioned, where the file to be uploaded and the public path where the media files would be sourced. This blog is configured with cloudinary free version.\nFront Matter #This is the place where the front matter are configured. It can be imported from the existing blog posts or can be configured manually. This creates a folder in the following path of the git repo .forestry/front_matter/templates.\nPreview Builds #One of the best things that I like from forestry is real time preview builds. The site is being built from the content that is being written, even before committing to git repo. The build time takes ~10 seconds to render the preview (the time is for my blog, your mileage may vary), which is 10 times lesser than netlify auto build.\nSince Hexo is not officially supported by forestry, we have to configure the preview commands in two places.\nThe following code to be added in the package.json file. Example here. \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;preview\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hexo server --draft --port 8080\u0026#34;, }, The preview command that we added, to be called in .forestry/settings.yml. Example here. build: preview_output_directory: public install_dependencies_command: npm install preview_docker_image: node:10 mount_path: \u0026#34;/srv\u0026#34; working_dir: \u0026#34;/srv\u0026#34; instant_preview_command: npm run preview Deployment #forestry stopped supporting deployment for sometime ð. So, have to use some other services for ci \u0026amp; cd, such as Netlify or Travis-CI.\nHow it works? #Forestry doesn\u0026rsquo;t do any magic on git. It just takes the repo \u0026amp; branch which was configured at the beginning and commit the changes directly into the Repository Branch.\nEach time you hit save button, while writing a blog post it commits to git repo. Since, Hexo is not officially supported by forestry, there is no inbuilt ON/OFF buttons available to stop draft posts getting published.\nIt is bit annoying, as my site is configured to build automatically for each commit and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to display half written posts to my visitors. (yes! there is an option available in netlify build settings to stop auto deploying builds - which I don\u0026rsquo;t want to modify for each builds!)\nI feel netlify-cms was done well in this aspect, which creates a pull request and it merge the PR, only when I hit publish.\nHandling Draft for Hexo #If you are using Hexo for sometime, you would know how the drafts are handled. Detailed explanation here. In short, the draft posts are available in _drafts folder and published posts are available in _posts folder. Moving a post from _drafts to _posts is not possible using forestry method.\nTo overcome this issue, I made few changes in front matter for getting the author\u0026rsquo;s input, whether the post is to be considered as draft - ON or OFF and the build script.\nWhen the draft is set to OFF, the script moves the post from _drafts to _posts folder. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t commit anything back to the source repo. The post still be available under _drafts.\nmy shell script is here (i\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in writing shell)\nfor file in source/_drafts/_.md; do if head -20 \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; | grep -Fiqx \u0026#34;draft: false\u0026#34; then mv \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; \u0026#34;source/_posts/\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Publishing $(basename \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34;) from draft\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;Keeping $(basename \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34;) in draft\u0026#34; fi done for file in source/_posts/_.md; do if head -20 \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; | grep -Fiqx \u0026#34;draft: true\u0026#34; then mv \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; \u0026#34;source/_drafts/\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Revoke publish post $(basename \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34;) to draft\u0026#34; fi done echo \u0026#34;Clean database\u0026#34; hexo clean echo \u0026#34;Build Posts\u0026#34; hexo generate I call this script via package.json and netlify.toml file, which builds my site automatically.\nNext Steps #I would like to add all the snippets, which are used in Hexo Next theme, so that I can call them easily whenever I write posts.\nNext steps from Forestry, which I would expect # I wish they support Hexo officially ð Start supporting tables in wysiwyg editor Fix small bugs in handling codes in the editor. What is the difference compared to Netlify CMS? # Netlify CMS requires many steps like configuring admin folder, enable identity services, give yourself permission, etc., which would be difficult for some people. I feel configuring and using forestry is easy. The preview builds are faster than Netlify. Forestry can be used in mobile phones, whereas Netlify CMS works only on desktop computers. Need not to build admin panel with site in Forestry, whereas it is mandatory in Netlify CMS. Removing \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; codes of Netlify CMS, increases Google Page speed slightly. The only downside I see from Forestry is that it commits the changes directly to git repo, whereas Netlify CMS creates a pull request (if github is used as git provider) for each post. This is best way to maintain draft posts. Thanks for reading this post.\nWishing everyone Merry Christmas ð ð and a Happy New Year 2020! ð\nPlease make a PR, if you feel that this can be done in a better way. I am happy to make it easy for everyone.

Google claims that project mainline benefits users on 3 components.\nSecurity Privacy Consistency The simple way to explain Project Mainline is to push Android Security Updates through Google Play store, instead of android updates.\nMore information on Project Mainline is available at Android Developer\u0026rsquo;s Blog\nIts good to get security updates directly from google rather than from the OEMs who don\u0026rsquo;t provide updates frequently (there are few exceptions like Essential) and keep the users vulnerable on published exploits.\nWhy OEMs don\u0026rsquo;t update their devices frequently? #There are reasons why the OEMs don\u0026rsquo;t provide security updates frequently.\nDevice sold in less numbers than expected. E.g., Xiaomi Mi4i - all the Xiaomi devices were provided frequent updates and at least 1 major android version update. But this one was left with lollipop version. Less support from chip manufacturers. E.g., Redmi Note 4 (Chinese version) vs. Redmi Note 4 (Global/Indian Version) - The Chinese version contains Mediatek and Global version contains Snapdragon as SoC. The Chinese version released with Marshmallow and ended with the same version, whereas the Global version launched with Marshmallow and Updated till Pie; which is 3 major updates received for the device. Skins. Most of the OEMs release their phone with heavily modified skins, which require additional time and effort to release an update. E.g., Xiaomi\u0026rsquo;s MIUI, Samsung\u0026rsquo;s OneUI, Oppo\u0026rsquo;s ColorOS, etc., More Devices less updates. The OEMs sells different variant of devices to cover the higher end to lower end markets, which makes them difficult to release updates for each of the model. The companies that release less variants makes the updates faster. E.g., Pixel, Essential, OnePlus. Kill support for old devices to force users to buy new devices. What happens if the OEMs provide support for 5+ years old devices? An average user would use the device until it became dead. Most of the OEMs abandon support for the older devices and provide support ~2 years. Exceptions: OnePlus, Xiaomi. How to overcome this issue? #So after all these, how we can use a device if it is more than 2 years old and keep up to date with security updates?\nBuy a device which has good developer support, E.g., Pixel, OnePlus, Essential, Xiaomi phones, Asus and Oppo are tyring to join this list now, by donating devices to developers to support. Switch to custom roms such as Lineage OS, once the OEM stop supporting the device. Users get at updates at least once in a month, if the device has good developer support. Make use of your phone\u0026rsquo;s full potential. What is with Project Mainline? #The title and all these above seems irrelevant to the topic. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it? No; there\u0026rsquo;s a link.\nInstalling Custom ROMs have 2 or more components.\nInstalling ROM Installing GAPPS Magisk or other mods If an user doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be tracked by Google, they just skip the 2nd option. But the updates are released through Google Play Store, instead of Google\u0026rsquo;s Android\u0026rsquo;s distribution method - the uers who do not uses Google Play Services will be left with vulnarablities.\nAndroid Developer\u0026rsquo;s blog says\nMainline components are still open sourced.\nWe are not sure, when it will become closed and opened only to the OEMs; its not sure how the open source projects will get updates.\nSo my doubts are that,\nGoogle is trying to build a big Big Wall of Gargen, so the users can get everything inside their eco system and not allowing the users to go out. It will be difficult for others to fork android and live without Google\u0026rsquo;s products. Users will have left with two options\nGet Google Play Services, if you want updates Left with vulnarablities, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want Google Play Services. We have to wait and see how it goes.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not an android developer and I use android phones extensively. All these information shared here are my thoughts.

I would say there are 3 types of people who write blogs.\nWho sees the platform as fresh, creates a blog starts writing a post or two then forget Who setup a blog, spending more time on tweaking the layout of the site than actually writing Who doesn\u0026rsquo;t create a blog, opt the ready-made one available in the market such as Medium The people who setup static websites falls in the first two categories.\nI feel there should be a medium to write something like a paper, notebook, diary to convert a thought that flash in our mind to a blog post. When thegap increases in converting a thought into writing, probably it will never be written. The medium is the main obstacle that reduces the frequency of blog posts and makes to zero at the end.\nI started writing in this blog in a text editor, push it to git. The main obstacle is that, I have to write it only on my personal computer, where git installed. When I don\u0026rsquo;t have a computer with git installed, thegap increases. I want to get rid of this.\nFound Netlify-CMS as the better alternate to write blog posts, preview then publish.\nI would wanted to write my experience in setting up Netlify-CMS for this blog.\nThis post is mainly for the people who already uses Hexo platform for generating static websites. I use Hexo-Theme-Next, which is the most used theme in Hexo platform, the post is 100% compatible for this theme, may be used as base for other Hexo themes as well. Create Hexo Blog and Deploy with Netlify #There is an article written in Netlify\u0026rsquo;s website, that explains how to create a blog using Hexo and deploy with Netlify. Refer this link if you are going to setup a new blog using Hexo or going to use Netlify as CI for building your blog. Configuring Netlify to build a static site is very easy; which also makes easy to configure Netlify-CMS. If you depend on other CI like Travis, Circle-CI or GitLab CI to build your sites, you need to use different authentication backends, which I have not tried yet. Enable Netlify-CMS #The following steps to be enabled for enabling Netlify-CMS.\nUpdate\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags Enable Netlify Identity Services Enable Git Gateway Configure CMS admin panel Build Site without Bugs Cloudinary as CDN for media Update\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; tags #There would be few lines of codes to be added in\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; sections, in order to enable Identity services.\nThere are multiple ways to do it, I prefer the easiest way by updating it in the netlify settings. Go to https://app.netlify.com/ select yourproject name \u0026gt;Site Settings \u0026gt;Build \u0026amp; Deploy \u0026gt;Post processing \u0026gt;Snippet injection \u0026gt;Add Snippet, then add the following codes in Head and Body sections.\nHead Section\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; #\u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Body Section\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; #\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; if (window.netlifyIdentity) { window.netlifyIdentity.on(\u0026#34;init\u0026#34;, user =\u0026gt; { if (!user) { window.netlifyIdentity.on(\u0026#34;login\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { document.location.href = \u0026#34;/admin/\u0026#34;; }); } }); } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The outcome should look like this.\nEnable Netlify Identity #Netlify Identity Services to be enabled for adding users and to enable authentication to them. Go toSettings \u0026gt;Identity \u0026gt;Enable Identity\nYou may add Github / GitLab / BitBucket / Google as external providers, if you or your users want to login any of these services for writing posts.\nEnable Git Gateway #Git Gateway connects the site to the git provider\u0026rsquo;s API.

Editorial Workflow works only for GitHub as of now. Comment or delete this line if you are using other hosts such as GitLab or BitBucket. media_folder This is where the images are stored in the source of the site. The default folder for hexo is located atsource/images public_folder This is where the images are available after building the site. The default folder for hexo is located at/images collections Collections are explained very well here. You can keep the source code without any changes, which works well for almost all the hexo themes. You may add additional collections based on the requirement. Netlify CMS is following different way in creating a draft post and preview it usingeditorial_workflow than Hexo is designed for drafting a post. It creates a pull request from the existing repo for each blog post. It builds the site immediately and available for preview in a unique URL. Once the post is madeReady andPublished, Netlify-CMS closes the pull request by merging the changes to the branch where the source is saved and deleting the branch made by pull request.\nEditorial Workflow i.e., creating a pull request / merging it back is applicable only for Github. GitLab and BitBucket works differently. Building Sites #You might have usedhexo g orhexo generate command to build the site. Though, the CMS wouldn\u0026rsquo;t load. Refer the following portion that fixes a bug.\nFixing Bug in rendering CMS Admin #I had an issue after making all the above configurations and I was unable to access the CMS page by visiting /admin page. Found that, thesource/admin/config.yml is renamed aspublic/admin/config.json with some modification after building the site. This can be fixed by adding admin folder contents in theskip_render option of hexoconfig.yml file.\nskip_render: admin/* Configure netlify.toml for Building Sites # This section is optional one.

Hosting images in the git repo is a bad idea, as the repo size would gradually increase when new posts are added with new images. Also GitHub started providing free private repositories, you might want the source of your site contents to be hidden from others. So, I would suggest using https://cloudinary.com for hosting the site images.\nYou need to create a free account from cloudinary and get the required details from the dashboard page.

However, the business model might affect if they do it, as most of the projects hosted in GitHub compared to the competitors.\nThere will be Pros and Cons on this change.\nThe Process #Creating new repository has an option to choose between Private and Public, which is very simple.\nTo make an existing repo private, go to Settings of the repository and scroll to the bottom where the Danger Zone exists and select the option to make the repository private.\nYou cannot make a repo to private, if it is forked from a public repo and Github asks to make a fresh repo for such cases.\nOnce you click on the Make Private button, it would ask to enter the repo name for confirmation.\nDone! These steps makes the existing repo private.\nThe Caveats #There are few things to notice, when the repos are made private.\nData Services #First thing to notice when the repo is private github stop accessing it unless you give persission. So there won\u0026rsquo;t be any audit done on the codes; vulnerability alers are disabled. Providing read-only access would solve the issue.\nGithub Wikis #Github Wikis will not be enabled for private repos, unless pro version is puchased. It is expected when the repo is private it is hidden from everyone, including wiki.\nGitHub Pages #Github pages won\u0026rsquo;t work on private repos, either the repository to be public or the pro version should be purchased.\nIf there is any static website hosted on github repo, the content and the images of the repo become private and won\u0026rsquo;t be accessible. Make it Public Again #The Process is same. Visit the Settings of the repo, then Danger Zone and make it public. Enter the repo name on the confirmation page.\nThe Pros and Cons # The change is very much expected for a long time, as people may want to hide their important projects from prying eyes. Since GitHub hosts most of the project and an user need not to switch between different providers for having private repos for free. Small organizations would benefit from this change as they can have free private repos with unlimited users. It might have negative impact on the growing developers,\nA developer groom by seeing the codes written by others and learn. If the option of making a repo is easy, most people might hide their work.

I do not remember having restrictions in taking screenshots on Windows PC. It used to be similar in Android platform until Google introduce restrictions from taking a screenshot.\nUpdate (on 16th Jul 2020) : I wanted to update this post for a long time, since the option suggested earlier is no longer works and I feel bad when many people visit this page by expecting to get a solution. The options are less now, try if it works for you. There are two options I would suggest at this date (16th Jul 2020) to byepass the screenthot.\n1. Root \u0026amp; Magisk Way # Warning: I\u0026rsquo;m not responsible if you brick your device using the root method. Rooting and modding your device may cause concequences that are unexpected. You should know what you are doing.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what is root and magisk, better try the option 2. This option is for the people who mod(ify) the android operating system as they wish. Not for noobs! Prerequisites # You will need device that has unlocked bootloader / rooted with magisk. You will need windows PC with 3+ GB RAM PC should have .Net Framework 4.7 or later installed PC should Jave installed Android Marshmallow (6.0) or later versions to be used. Some knowlege on flashing / modding android device Process #The detailed process is explained in XDA-Developers forum, but I would like to give a small overview here.\nBackup your data, this may result surprises. So, backup your device data first. Enable Developer settings, enable USB debugging then connect via USB cable to your PC. Authorize connection Run \u0026ldquo;SmaliPatcher.exe\u0026rdquo;, First startup will automatically download the latest necessary binary\u0026rsquo;s. Select secure flag patch - this will bypass the screenshot restriction Click on \u0026ldquo;ADB PATCH\u0026rdquo; button (no need to browse .jar file). Once the process has completed, magisk module will be generated in the same directory as \u0026ldquo;SmaliPatcher.exe\u0026rdquo; named: SmaliPatcherModule-X.X.X.X-fOmey@XDA.zip. Copy the magisk module to your device and flash it from recovery such as TWRP Reboot \u0026amp; Enable smali patcher module in magisk. There are more modules available in the smarlipatcher, if you need you can use them as well. But remember this option requires more knowledge in modding devices and not for all the people.\n2. The Older and Simpler Method! # Note: This option was suggested in 2018, which may not work on the newer devices / newer versions of Android / newer versions of Google app. Instruct Google app to take screenshot. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\nPrerequisites #Make sure you have the following on your Android device.\nYour device\u0026rsquo;s Android version should be Marshmallow (6.0) to Pie (9.0) Google App Option to trigger Google Assistant (either press and hold home button \u0026amp; \u0026lsquo;OK Google\u0026rsquo; by voice) Enable the option to read screen context (available in Google App \u0026gt; More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Phone \u0026gt; Use screen context) Process # Just open the app that has restrictions in taking screenshot. Say \u0026lsquo;OK Google\u0026rsquo; or press \u0026amp; hold the Home button, which will trigger the Google Assistant. Say Take Screenshot, which will take the screenshot of the app that has restrictions. You can share it via other applications or save in the storage. That\u0026rsquo;s all!! This would NOT require rooting, installing any unknown applications on your phone. It would work untill Google fixes this bug!\nVideo Explanation #I have made a video, to explain the same using Telegram Secret Chat feature.

The form should be available as below: POV / Page : FY18 -\u0026gt; BegBalance -\u0026gt; Current -\u0026gt; Working -\u0026gt; Local -\u0026gt; No Entity\nBU1 BU2 BU3 BUn OU1 Yes OU2 Yes OU3 Yes OU4 Yes The dyn_Valid Intersection member would give an output as 0 or 1 (yes or no) for these BU / OU irrespective of selections in the other dimensions.\nStep 3: Include the dyn_Valid Intersection member in the forms and setup validation rules. #Open the form in Edit mode and go to Layout tab.\nAdd the dyn_Valid Intersection member in the first row of every form, where you want to set up this validation. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find a way to achieve the output without adding a row Select Validation Rules from right pane, click the + sign and setup a validation rule as like the screen shot\nI keep the process format in grey, as it would mimic the user that the cell is locked for editing, though it is editable. You may add a Validation Message which will be displayed to the users upon error.\nOnce done, click Validate to validate the Validation Rule ð\nNow open the form to input data and select incorrect combination from the Page section / drop down. You will see all the cells are grayed out. When you try to input data in a store member, you will get the error message that was setup in the Validation Rule.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t restrict user to input on the invalid intersections. However, it just give a warning to them that they have selected invalid intersections and inputting data. Step 4: Setup a Business rule to validate the intersections while saving form. #As an additional way to restrict processing calculations for the invalid intersections, we can setup a Business Rule and place it in the first position with @Return message. sample code is given below:\nFIX(\u0026#34;FY18\u0026#34;,{RTP_BU},{RTP_OU}) \u0026#34;Valid Intersection\u0026#34;( IF(\u0026#34;dyn_Valid Intersection\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026gt; 1)) @RETURN(\u0026#34;Invalid BU x OU selected, pls select the valid BU x OU\u0026#34;, Error); ENDIF) ENDFIX All these checks would work only for form. There\u0026rsquo;s no way to restrict, if an user prefer to load data through ad-hoc smartview query or try loading through back end. Conclusion #This would be very easy (Step 3 is not needed), if Oracle provides an option to run a Business Rule while loading the form with Run Time Prompt. It is not supported and we need to do all these steps as workaround.\n","date":"3 June 2018","permalink":"/posts/hyperion/valid-intersections-in-hyperion-planning/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently encountered with a requirement that the users should input data in the Planning Forms only for Valid Intersection. There\u0026rsquo;s an option to setup Valid Intersection in PBCS.

We start something and forget, until we make it as routine. Meanwhile, I was doing some analysis and checks, etc on the blogging platform. Like to share the same here..\nMost of the contents updated in this post aren\u0026rsquo;t relevant today, as I have migrated this blog from Hexo to Hugo platform, for some reason. Fore more info visit the github repository where the contents are hosted. The Static Blog Platform #Why Static Blog? I have tried using the ready-made blogging platforms such as Blogger, WordPress, etc., But I settled with Static blogging platform, for its simplicity and speed, also I want to try something in a hard way to make it work (Actually setting up a static blog is not that hard).\nI can write posts when I am off line, using a notepad++. Then just push to git repository when I connected to Internet. Git provides the history / version control for all the modifications that I do. If I feel a change that I made recently not working, I can just use git revert command to go back to the previous state.\nI have tried different static site generators the order listed below:\nJekyll - Lot of themes available, Github build the pages automatically. But, felt it is slow. Still my primary domain page https://anbuchelva.in is running on Jekyll. Edit: Moved to static page now. Hugo - Simple. But Hexo won my heart. Ghost - Subscription based, not my cup of tea. Hexo - The Winner!! though most of the users are from china, thanks to Google translate Gatsby - The post title would have changed to the Hardest way, if I have used Gatsby. I have tried all the platforms finally settled with Hexo for the speed and the vast number of plug-ins. Github pages automatically build pages, if I use Jekyll. I need a CI to build the site, or I need to deploy it from my PC whenever I write a post using Hexo. I have tried different CI such as Travis-CI, Circle-CI, Netlify, Gitlab CI, etc.,\nDomain #I have purchased this domain from Google Domains. I pay $12 per annum for it, which is the only service that I pay money when setting up this blog.\nStill thinking of moving it to a different domain name, which can be easily remembered. I know the the word \u0026lsquo;anbuchelva\u0026rsquo; would be hard to pronounce who are not from South India.\nHosting #The next question that arise in your mind, what about hosting? Aren\u0026rsquo;t you paying any money for it? The answer is yes. I\u0026rsquo;m not paying anything for hosting, as I host it in Github pages\nThere are few alternates available such as Gitlab Pages, Bitbucket, Netlify, etc., I have settled with Github Pages + Cloudflare for hosting and CDN services. Github pages provide very fast server response than the others that I have listed above. This improves the Google page speed drastically.\nStill thinking of moving the source of this blog to Gitlab or Bitbucket for privacy and host the pages that are built in Github. Github doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer Private Repository services for free. Few differences when comparing Gitlab and Github.\nService Gitlab Github Private Repository Unlimited private repositories Not available Continuous Integration 2000 Hours of CI engine per Month Not available, have to depend on other CI cervices like Travis-CI, Circe-CI, Netlify Encryption The connection is encrypted between Gitlab and Cloudflare No encryption provided for custom domain Server Response Time Slow Fast improvement in Google Page Speed test for more than 20 points Netlify CMS Integration Not available yet Available Cloudflare #I should thank Cloudflare for their free service for ultra fast CDN and free encryption certificate, caching etc. This increased the site speed from 60/100 to 95+/100.\nMarkdown #Writing posts in Markdown language is very easy than using traditional HTML tags. It is in readable format so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to modify, when the changes needed. Whenever I make changes and push the commits to git repository, the CI automatically build the site to HTML pages. When the user opens up the website, they access the webpages which are built already. There\u0026rsquo;s no to and fro data data movement to load the pages.\nTheme #I use Next in this blog. Simple and look professional, yet modern. You will really know the customizations when start using it. I love it!\nRuda font is being used all over the place except the code blocks. I use the same font in my Android device as well.\nContinuous Integration [aka] CI #There would be a separate post needed, if I want to write about CI and the experiments that I have done, experiences that I have gained with each of the CI platform. As of now, I use Travis-CI and Netlify for building the site. I would write a separate post; the link will be available here when I am done.\nPost Comments #I am still in dilemma whether to use Disqus (most websites uses it, login using social networking is possible) or to use Gitment.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no privacy guaranteed when using Disqus, Gitment is open sourced and privacy oriented. The problem is not all the users have github account to use Gitment comment system. I may add staticman, if I succeed.\nContent Management System #What is the success of Wordpress, the simple content management system. As of now, I have to depend on my personal computer, where the git is configured and I can locally run Hexo to see the output before publishing any post. Sometimes it is painful, If I have an online portal, where I can go and write posts and if it automatically publishes it, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be a welcome change.\nCurrently Netlify provides such option. When a new post created, Netlify creates pull request and builds the website temporarily. Once we feel the post is ready for publishing, it automatically merge the pull request and delete the temporary branch.\nI have set it up already for this blog, but still not using it 100%, as I do some tweaks in the website. Netlify breaks if there are any commits passed during the draft to publish phase. Ideally I will move into it in some days.\nConclusion #Thanks for reading the large post. There\u0026rsquo;s no technical details provided how I have setup each of the above mentioned services. I may write in more detailed way, when I get time. Feel free to comment/ask questions for clarifications.\nHappy Writing!!!\n","date":"1 June 2018","permalink":"/posts/blog/blogging-in-the-hard-way/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have started this blog in last November, after that I did not write anything, as like the way it happens every time.
