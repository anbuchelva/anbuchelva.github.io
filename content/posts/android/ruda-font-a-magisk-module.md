I started rooting Android Phone since 2013, starting from my first Android Mobile - [Samsung Galaxy Ace 2](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_ace_2_i8160-4559.php). I was a user of Super-SU made by [chainfire](https://chainfire.eu/); then I switched to [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) to root my phones systemless-ly.

I had used many modules built by developers, but never had a chance to work on a new module by myself.

I was using [Substratum](https://github.com/substratum/substratum) to modify the default look of Android. Mostly I keep the themes untouched except the font which I choose [Ruda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ruda).  Since Google released Android Pie (9.0), the substratum has limitations in supporting fonts.  So, I had to stay with the default robarto font or use the other font packages that are available as Magisk modules.

However, the love of Ruda font ~~(the same font that is used in this blog)~~ made me to make my first Magisk module.  I have never thought it would be that much simple to make a new Magisk module.  The same is available [here](https://github.com/anbuchelva/Ruda-Font-Magisk-Module).

The installation is simple.

* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/anbuchelva/Ruda-Font-Magisk-Module/releases)
* Boot into custom recovery such as TWRP - make sure your phone is having unlocked boot loader and custom recovery, Magisk are installed
* Flash the package from custom recovery.

That's all. You get a wonderful font pack on your Android.
